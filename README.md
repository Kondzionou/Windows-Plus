About:
Windows 11+ is a program that optimizes Windows 11 and 10 probably too because reg files and cmd commands have not changed at all. 

How to Use:
Before making any changes settings etc. Disable UAC!
How To Disable UAC:
-Run as ADMIN
-Go to first option "Disable UAC RESTART PC!"
-Go to first option again and the program should exit 
-restart your pc
U ARE DONE!

Now if you want look does changes applyed
go to regedit.exe paste HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System and if "EnableLUA" is on 1 something went wrong (Sometimes windows is dumb) and change it at your own. If "EnableLUA" is on 0 then you can go to next steps!

2. Delete Temporary/Log Files 
Just as name say it delete all usless files from your pc

3. Game Optimalization
Optymalizes things typical for gamers like Fullscreen Fps Boost what gives more fps in fullscreen mode

4. Debload 
From That option you can choose what things will be deleted like Cortana or Office.
